            Hello Team,

            Package Contents:
            1. For Translation:
               - messages_en.properties: Latest English content requiring translation
            
            2. Reference Files:
               - Previously translated language files from our last vendor delivery
               (These files are included for reference and consistency)

            Action Required:
            - Please forward the messages_en.properties file to the vendor for translation
            - The reference files will help maintain translation consistency
